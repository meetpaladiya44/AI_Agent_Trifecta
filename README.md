# OGXBT: Crypto Signal Transparency Platform

Welcome to **OGXBT**, the ultimate tool for verifying crypto trading signal performance with transparency and trust. Built for a hackathon, OGXBT combines blockchain authentication, AI-driven computation, and user-friendly design to empower traders and signal providers alike.

## What is OGXBT?

Crypto trading signals guide traders, but their true performance is often a mystery. OGXBT solves this by letting you:

- **Instantly Analyze Signals**: Paste a signal from Telegram and get a breakdown of entry points, stop losses, and take profits.
- **Review Historical Performance**: Connect your signal provider account (e.g., Kaito, CTXBT) via API for detailed reports over any date range.

Powered by the **0G Compute Network**, OGXBT ensures every analysis is accurate and verifiable, using zero-knowledge proofs and trusted execution environments—all while keeping your data private.

## Why OGXBT?

- **Transparency**: See how signals _actually_ perform, not just what's promised.
- **Trust**: Computations backed by 0G's cutting-edge AI and blockchain tech.
- **Privacy**: No personal data stored or shared.
- **Ease**: Simple login with Metamask, no complex setup.

## Features

- **Instant Signal Breakdown**: Paste a signal, get a performance summary in seconds.
- **Historical Analysis**: Connect via API for comprehensive trade reports.
- **Verifiable Results**: Powered by 0G Compute Network's AI inference and fine-tuning.
- **Secure Login**: Authenticate seamlessly with Metamask.
- **Supported Providers**: CTXBT, with room to expand.

## How It Works

1. **Login**: Connect your Metamask wallet to OGXBT.
2. **Analyze a Signal**: Paste a Telegram signal for an instant performance summary.
3. **Dive Deeper**: Enter your API key from a signal provider, pick a date range, and get a full report.
4. **Trust the Results**: 0G Compute Network ensures every calculation is reliable and verifiable.

## Tech Stack

- **0G Compute Network**: Verifiable AI computations with ZK proofs and TEEs ([Learn More](https://docs.0g.ai/build-with-0g/compute-network/overview)).
- **Metamask**: Secure Ethereum wallet integration for authentication.
- **API Integrations**: Connects with CTXBT, and potentially more providers.
- **Frontend**: Intuitive interface (built with [insert framework if applicable, e.g., React]).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox)
- Metamask extension installed
- Ethereum account connected to Metamask

### Steps

1. Visit the OGXBT platform (URL coming soon—demo available at the hackathon!).
2. Click "Login" and connect your Metamask wallet.
3. Choose your analysis:
   - Paste a signal from Telegram for instant results.
   - Enter an API key (e.g., from CTxbt) and select a date range for historical insights.

## Privacy & Security

OGXBT prioritizes your privacy:

- Only signal data is processed—no personal info stored.
- API connections are secure and limited to analysis needs.
- 0G's trustless computation ensures integrity without compromise.

## Future Vision

- Expand signal provider support (e.g., Binance, TradingView).
- Add real-time signal tracking and alerts.
- Integrate more 0G Compute Network features like custom AI model fine-tuning for signal prediction.
